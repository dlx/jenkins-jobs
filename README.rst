============
Jenkins jobs
============

This is jenkins-job-builder_ setup for tcpcloud Jenkins jobs.

.. _jenkins-job-builder: http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/

Installation
============

First install jenkins-job-builder.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install jenkins-job-builder

Edit ``/etc/jenkins_jobs/jenkins_jobs.ini`` with access to running jenkins
instance:

.. code-block:: ini

    [job_builder]
    recursive=True

    [jenkins]
    user=admin
    password=<jenkins_admin_password>
    url=http://localhost:8080

Clone repository, fix variables (especially `defaults.yaml`), possibly setup
projects as you like. ``git grep -e FIXME -e example`` is your friend :-)

Finally you can create jenkins jobs.

.. code-block:: bash

    jenkins-jobs --flush-cache update `pwd`
